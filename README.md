# Ants vs. Some-Bees

This module is a simple turn-based tower defense game called Ants vs. Some Bees (inspired by the PopCap game [Plants vs. Zombies](http://www.popcap.com/plants-vs-zombies-1) using Object Oriented and Strongly Typed [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). In this game (which is played on the command-line), the player populates an ant colony with the bravest ants they can muster. The ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade their territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath! üêùüêùüêù

In the `docs/` directory, there is a fully implemented [JavaDoc tags](http://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/) API documentation for this application using [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/)

This application greatly utilizes various software architecture _Desgin_ _Patterns_ such as Factory Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Decorator Pattern, Composite Pattern, and State Pattern.

It looks something like this:

## Running the Program
* `git clone` the repo to your local machine
* `cd` to the current directory
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `npm start` to start running the game

## Playing the Game

A game of Ants vs. Some-Bees is played in turns. Each turn, the player can deploy ants into different spots in the colony (as long as the colony has enough food for that ant). Once the player has finished deploying ants, the turn is over. At the end of the turn, all the insects (ants first, then bees) perform their individual actions: ants throw leaves at bees, and bees sting ants. Then any special environmental effects (e.g., from the tunnels) occur. Finally any new bees arrive from the hive, and the next turn starts.

The game ends either when a bee reaches the ant queen (you lose), or the entire bee flotilla has been vanquished (you win).

### Player actions are performed by entering commands at the command-line. The following commands are supported:

`deploy <antType> <tunnel>` This command deploys a kind of ant to a particular tunnel section (assuming there is enough food!). The `antType` is the name of the ant's type, such as `Thrower` or `Grower` (use the `tab` key to get an auto-completing list of options). The tunnel is the "row,col" coordinates separated by a comma. For example:

  `deploy Thrower 2,3`
will create a Thrower ant at the 3rd spot of the 2nd row (right about where the word "these" is in the example above).

`remove <tunnel>` This command removes the ant from a particular spot (using the same "row,col" syntax as deploy).

`boost <boost> <tunnel>` This command will give a kind of boosting resource to the ant in a particular tunnel (assuming you have such a boost, and an ant is there!). The boost is the name of the boost type (e.g., FlyingLeaf; use tab to autocomplete for options), and tunnel is the same "row,col" syntax as deploy.

`turn` This command ends the current turn. All the ants will act, then the bees will act, then the tunnels will act, then new bees will invade, and then the next turn will start.

`show` This command re-displays the current game board (in case you've forgotten it!)

`help` This command will give you information about any of the commands. Just entering help by itself will give you a list of commands.

`exit` This command quits the program. You can also hit ctrl-c twice to quit.

### The Ants

The colony can be defended by the following types of ants:

Grower (G) Growers are ants that grow food and boosts. Each turn a Grower ant will either produce 1 food for the colony or occasionally a boost that can be given to the ants. Growers cost 1 food to deploy and have 1 armor.

Thrower (T) Throwers are ants that throw leaves at bees to drive them off. Each turn a Thrower ant will throw one leaf at the closest bee within range. Note that Throwers can throw different leaves when boosted. Throwers cost 4 food to deploy and have 1 armor

Eater (E) Eaters are ants that will eat the bees outright! On its turn, an Eater ant will swallow a bee in the same tunnel and begin digesting. It takes 3 turns to eat the bee and be ready to eat another. If the Eater is damaged or perishes quickly after swallowing the bee, it may cough up the invader! Eaters cost 4 food to deploy and have 2 armor.

Scuba (S) Scuba ants are like Throwers and throw leaves at the bees. However, Scuba ants are able to survive in water-filled tunnels. Scuba ants cost 5 food and have 1 armor.

Guard (_) Guard ants are able to protect other ants, occupying the same tunnel as them (this is the only time you can have more than one ant in a tunnel). When a guard is in the tunnel, any attacks from the bees hit it first, and only hurt the protected ant if the Guard perishes. Guards cost 4 food to deploy and have 2 armor.

Note that Guards are shown on the board as underlining the ant they are protecting. If they are not protecting a particular ant, they are shown as an x.

More ant types could be added to the game as future expansions!

### Boosts

You are also able to give ants boosts that are dug up by the Growers. If an ant has a boost, it will use that instead of performing its turn as normal. Each boost is lost once used. You are able to offer the following boosts:

FlyingLeaf This leaf is particularly well-shaped and aerodynamic, allowing it to be thrown further.

StickyLeaf This leaf is covered in spider webs, making it sticky. Bees hit by this leaf become stuck, unable to leave the current tunnel until it frees itself on its next turn.

IcyLeaf This leaf is covered in ice because of global climate change. Bees hit by this leaf become cold, and will not sting the any bees until it warms up on its next turn.

BugSpray Ants can use this dangerous item to wreak havoc on a single tunnel. Releasing bug spray will deal significant damage to every single insect in the current tunnel (including the poor ant who activates it!)

Use boosts wisely to help defend the colony!
